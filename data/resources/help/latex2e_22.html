<a name="index-graphics" class="anchor"></a>
<a name="index-graphics-package" class="anchor"></a>

<p>You can use graphics such as PNG or PDF files in your LaTeX document.
You need an additional package, which comes standard with LaTeX.
This example is the short how-to.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\include{graphicx}  % goes in the preamble
  ...
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plot.pdf}
</pre></div>

<p>To use the commands described here your document preamble must contain
either <code>\usepackage{graphicx}</code> or
<code>\usepackage{graphics}</code>. Most of the time, <samp>graphicx</samp> is the
better choice.
</p>
<p>Graphics come in two main types, raster and vector.  LaTeX can use
both.  In raster graphics the file contains an entry for each location
in an array, describing what color it is.  An example is a photograph,
in JPG format.  In vector graphics, the file contains a list of
instructions such as &lsquo;<samp>draw a circle with this radius and that
center</samp>&rsquo;.  An example is a line drawing produced by the Asymptote
program, in PDF format.  Generally vector graphics are more useful
because you can rescale their size without pixelation or other problems,
and because they often have a smaller size.
</p>
<p>There are systems particularly well-suited to make graphics for a
LaTeX document.  For example, these allow you to use the same fonts
as in your document.  LaTeX comes with a <code>picture</code> environment
(see <a href="latex2e_8.html#picture">picture</a>) that has simple capabilities.  Besides that, there are
other ways to include the graphic-making commands in the document.  Two
such systems are the PSTricks and TikZ packages.  There are also systems
external to LaTeX, that generate a graphic that you include using the
commands of this chapter.  Two that use a programming language are
Asymptote and MetaPost.  One that uses a graphical interface is Xfig.
Full description of these systems is outside the scope of this document;
see their documentation on CTAN.

<h3 class="section"><code>graphics</code> package options</h3>

<a name="index-graphics-package-options" class="anchor"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-graphics-package" class="anchor"></a>

<p>Synopsis (must be in the document preamble):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\usepackage[<var>comma-separated option list</var>]{graphics}
</pre></div>

<p>or
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\usepackage[<var>comma-separated option list</var>]{graphicx}
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>graphicx</code> package has a format for optional arguments to the
<code>\includegraphics</code> command that is convenient (it is the key-value
format), so it is the better choice for new documents.  When you load
the <samp>graphics</samp> or <samp>graphicx</samp> package with <code>\usepackage</code>
there are two kinds of available options.
</p>
<p>The first is that LaTeX does not contain information about different
output systems but instead depends on information stored in a
<em>printer driver</em> file.  Normally you should not specify the driver
option in the document, and instead rely on your system&rsquo;s default. One
advantage of this is that it makes the document portable across systems.
</p>
<p>For completeness here is a list of the drivers.  The currently relevant
ones are: <samp>dvipdfmx</samp>, <samp>dvips</samp>, <samp>dvisvgm</samp>, <samp>luatex</samp>,
<samp>pdftex</samp>, <samp>xetex</samp>.  The two <samp>xdvi</samp> and <samp>oztex</samp> are
essentially aliases for <samp>dvips</samp> (and <samp>xdvi</samp> is monochrome).
Ones that should not be used for new systems are: <samp>dvipdf</samp>,
<samp>dvipdfm</samp>, <samp>dviwin</samp>, <samp>dvipsone</samp>, <samp>emtex</samp>,
<samp>pctexps</samp>, <samp>pctexwin</samp>, <samp>pctexhp</samp>, <samp>pctex32</samp>,
<samp>truetex</samp>, <samp>tcidvi</samp>, <samp>vtex</samp> (and <samp>dviwindo</samp> is an
alias for <samp>dvipsone</samp>).  These are stored in files with a
<samp>.def</samp> extension, such as <samp>pdftex.def</samp>.
</p>
<p>The second kind of options are below.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>demo</code></dt>
<dd><p>Instead of an image file, LaTeX puts in a 150&nbsp;pt by 100&nbsp;pt
rectangle (unless another size is specified in the
<code>\includegraphics</code> command).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>draft</code></dt>
<dd><p>For each graphic file, it is not shown but instead the file name is
printed in a box of the correct size.  In order to determine the size,
the file must be present.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>final</code></dt>
<dd><p>(Default) Override any previous <code>draft</code> option, so that the
document shows the contents of the graphic files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>hiderotate</code></dt>
<dd><p>Do not show rotated text.  (This allows for the possibility that a
previewer does not have the capability to rotate text.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>hidescale</code></dt>
<dd><p>Do not show scaled text.  (This allows for the possibility that a
previewer does not have the capability to scale.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>hiresbb</code></dt>
<dd><p>In a PS or EPS file the graphic size may be specified in two ways.  The
<code>%%BoundingBox</code> lines describe the graphic size using integer
multiples of a PostScript point, that is, integer multiples of 1/72
inch.  A later addition to the PostScript language allows decimal
multiples, such as 1.23, in <code>%%HiResBoundingBox</code> lines.  This
option has LaTeX to read the size from the latter.

TeX distribution&rsquo;s documentation.

<a name="g_t_005cgraphicspath-1" class="anchor"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><code>\graphicspath</code></h4>

<a name="index-_005cgraphicspath" class="anchor"></a>

<p>Synopsis:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\graphicspath{<var>list of dir names inside curly brackets</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Declare a list of directories to search for graphics files.  This allows
you to later say something like <code>\includegraphics{lion.png}</code>
instead of having to give its path.
</p>
<p>LaTeX always looks for graphic files first in the current directory.
The declaration below tells the system to then look in the subdirectory
<samp>pix</samp>, and then <samp>../pix</samp>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\usepackage{graphicx}   % or graphics; put in preamble
  ...
\graphicspath{ {pix/} {../pix/} }
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>\graphicspath</code> declaration is optional.  If you don&rsquo;t include
it then LaTeX&rsquo;s default is to search all of the places that it
usually looks for a file (it uses LaTeX&rsquo;s <code>\input@path</code>).  In
particular, in this case one of the places it looks is the current
directory.
</p>
<p>Enclose each directory name in curly braces; for example, above it says
&lsquo;<samp><code>{pix}</code></samp>&rsquo;.  Do this even if there is only one directory.
Each directory name must end in a forward slash, <samp>/</samp>.  This is true
even on Windows, where good practice is to use forward slashes for all
the directory separators since it makes the document portable to other
platforms.  If you have spaces in your directory name then use double
quotes, as with <code>{&quot;my docs/&quot;}</code>. Getting one of these rules wrong
will cause LaTeX to report <code>Error: File `<var>filename</var>' not
found</code>.
</p>
<p>Basically, the algorithm is that with this example, after looking in the
current directory,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\graphicspath{ {pix/} {../pix/} }
...
\usepackage{lion.png}
</pre></div>

<p>for each of the listed directories, LaTeX concatenates it with the
file name and searches for the result, checking for <samp>pix/lion.png</samp>
and then <samp>../pix/lion.png</samp>.  This algorithm means that the
<code>\graphicspath</code> command does not recursively search subdirectories:
if you issue <code>\graphicspath{{a/}}</code> and the graphic is in
<samp>a/b/lion.png</samp> then LaTeX will not find it.  It also means that
you can use absolute paths such as
<code>\graphicspath{{/home/jim/logos/}}</code> or
<code>\graphicspath{{C:/Users/Albert/Pictures/}}</code>.  However, using
these means that the document is not portable.  (You could preserve
portability by adjusting your TeX system settings configuration file
parameter <code>TEXINPUTS</code>; see the documentation of your system.)
</p>
<p>You can use <code>\graphicspath</code> anywhere in the document.  You can use
it more than once.  Show its value with
<code>\makeatletter\typeout{\Ginput@path}\makeatother</code>.
</p>
<p>The directories are taken with respect to the base file.  That is,
suppose that you are working on a document based on <samp>book/book.tex</samp>
and it contains <code>\include{chapters/chap1}</code>.  If in
<samp>chap1.tex</samp> you put <code>\graphicspath{{plots/}}</code> then
LaTeX will not search for graphics in <samp>book/chapters/plots</samp>, but
instead in <samp>book/plots</samp>.
</p>

<a name="g_t_005cDeclareGraphicsExtensions-1" class="anchor"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><code>\DeclareGraphicsExtensions</code></h4>

<a name="index-_005cDeclareGraphicsExtensions" class="anchor"></a>

<p>Synopses:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{<var>comma-separated list of file extensions</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Declare the filename extensions to try.  This allows you to specify the
order in which to choose graphic formats when you include graphic files
by giving the filename without the extension, as in
<code>\includegraphics{functionplot}</code>.
</p>
<p>In this example, LaTeX will find files in the PNG format before PDF
files.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png,PNG,.pdf,.PDF}
  ...
\includegraphics{lion}   % will find <samp>lion.png</samp> before <samp>lion.pdf</samp> 
</pre></div>

<p>Because the file name <samp>lion</samp> does not have a period, LaTeX uses
the extension list.  For each directory in the graphics path
(see <a href="#g_t_005cgraphicspath">\graphicspath</a>), LaTeX will try the extensions in the order
given.  If it does not find such a file after trying all the directories
and extensions then it reports &lsquo;<samp>! LaTeX Error: File `<samp>lion</samp>'
not found</samp>&rsquo;.  Note that you must include the periods at the start of the
extensions.
</p>
<p>Because GNU/Linux and Macintosh filenames are case sensitive, the list of
file extensions is case sensitive on those platforms.  The Windows
platform is not case sensitive.
</p>
<p>You are not required to include <code>\DeclareGraphicsExtensions</code> in
your document; the printer driver has a sensible default.  For example,
the most recent <samp>pdftex.def</samp> has this extension list.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">.png,.pdf,.jpg,.mps,.jpeg,.jbig2,.jb2,.PNG,.PDF,.JPG,.JPEG,.JBIG2,.JB2
</pre></div>

<p>You can use this command anywhere in the document.  You can use it more
than once.  Show its value with
<code>\makeatletter\typeout{\Gin@extensions}\makeatother</code>.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="g_t_005cDeclareGraphicsRule" class="anchor"></a>
<a name="g_t_005cDeclareGraphicsRule-1" class="anchor"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><code>\DeclareGraphicsRule</code></h4>

<a name="index-_005cDeclareGraphicsRule" class="anchor"></a>

<p>Synopsis:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\DeclareGraphicsRule{<var>extension</var>}{<var>type</var>}{<var>size-file extension</var>}{<var>command</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Declare how to handle graphic files whose names end in <var>extension</var>.
</p>
<p>This example declares that all files with names have the form
<samp>filename-without-dot.mps</samp> will be treated as output from MetaPost,
meaning that the printer driver will use its MetaPost-handling code to
input the file.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\DeclareGraphicsRule{.mps}{mps}{.mps}{}
</pre></div>

<p>This
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}
</pre></div>

<p>tells LaTeX that it should handle as MetaPost output any file with an
extension not covered by another rule, so it covers <samp>filename.1</samp>,
<samp>filename.2</samp>, etc.
</p>
<p>This describes the four arguments.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>extension</var></dt>
<dd><p>The file extension to which this rule applies. The extension is anything
after and including the first dot in the filename.  Use the Kleene star,
<code>*</code>, to denote the default behaviour for all undeclared extensions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>type</var></dt>
<dd><p>The type of file involved.  This type is a string that must be defined
in the printer driver. For instance, files with extensions <samp>.ps</samp>,
<samp>.eps</samp>, or <samp>.ps.gz</samp> may all be classed as type <code>eps</code>.
All files of the same type will be input with the same internal command
by the printer driver. For example, the file types that <samp>pdftex</samp>
recognizes are: <code>jpg</code>, <code>jbig2</code>, <code>mps</code>, <code>pdf</code>,
<code>png</code>, <code>tif</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>size-file extension</var></dt>
<dd><p>The extension of the file to be read to determine the size of the
graphic, if there is such a file. It may be the same as <var>extension</var>
but it may be different.
</p>
<p>As an example, consider a PostScript graphic.  To make it smaller, it
might be compressed into a <samp>.ps.gz</samp> file.  Compressed files are not
easily read by LaTeX so you can put the bounding box information in a
separate file. If <var>size-file extension</var> is empty then you must
specify size information in the arguments of <code>\includegraphics</code>.
</p>
<p>If the driver file has a procedure for reading size files for
<code>type</code> then that will be used, otherwise it will use the procedure
for reading <samp>.eps</samp> files.  (Thus you may specify the size of bitmap
files in a file with a PostScript style <code>%%BoundingBox</code> line if no
other format is available.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>command</var></dt>
<dd><p>A command that will be applied to the
file. This is very often left blank. This command must start with a
single backward quote.  Thus,
<code>\DeclareGraphicsRule{.eps.gz}{eps}{.eps.bb}{`gunzip -c
#1}</code> specifies that any file with the extension <samp>.eps.gz</samp> should
be treated as an <code>eps</code> file, with the BoundingBox information
stored in the file with extension <samp>.eps.bb</samp>, and that the command
<code>gunzip -c</code> will run on your platform to decompresses the file.
</p>
<p>Such a command is specific to your platform.  In addition, your TeX
system must allow you to run external commands; as a security measure
modern systems restrict running commands unless you explicitly allow it.
See the documentation for your TeX distribution.

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\includegraphics{<var>filename</var>}
\includegraphics[<var>key-value list</var>]{<var>filename</var>}
\includegraphics*{<var>filename</var>}
\includegraphics*[<var>key-value list</var>]{<var>filename</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Include a graphics file.  The starred form <code>\includegraphics*</code> will
clip the graphic to the size specified, while for the unstarred form any
part of the graphic that is outside the box of the specified size will
over-print the surrounding area.
</p>
<p>This 
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\usepackage{graphicx}  % in preamble
  ...
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{plot.pdf}
\end{center}
</pre></div>

<p>will incorporate into the document the graphic in <samp>plot.pdf</samp>,
centered and at its nominal size.  You can also give a path to the file,
as with <code>\includegraphics{graphics/plot.pdf}</code>.  To specify a list
of locations to search for the file, see <a href="#g_t_005cgraphicspath">\graphicspath</a>.
</p>
<p>If your filename includes spaces then put it in double quotes. An example
is <code>\includegraphics{&quot;sister picture.jpg&quot;}</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>\includegraphics{<var>filename</var>}</code> command decides on the
type of graphic by splitting <var>filename</var> on the first dot.  You can
use <var>filename</var> with no dot, as in <code>\includegraphics{turing}</code>
and then LaTeX tries a sequence of extensions such as <code>.png</code> and
<code>.pdf</code> until it finds a file with that extension
(see <a href="#g_t_005cDeclareGraphicsExtensions">\DeclareGraphicsExtensions</a>).
</p>
<p>If your file name contains dots before the extension then you can hide
them with curly braces, as in
<code>\includegraphics{{plot.2018.03.12.a}.pdf}</code>.  Or, if you use
the <samp>graphicx</samp> package then you can use the options <code>type</code> and
<code>ext</code>; see below.  This and other filename issues are also handled
with the package <samp>grffile</samp>.
</p>
<p>This example puts a graphic in a figure environment so LaTeX can
move it to the next page if fitting it on the current page is awkward
(see <a href="latex2e_8.html#figure">figure</a>).
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3cm]{lungxray.jpg}
  \caption{The evidence is overwhelming: don't smoke.}  \label{fig:xray}
\end{figure}
</pre></div>

<p>This places a graphic that will not float, so it is sure to appear at
this point in the document even if makes LaTeX stretch the text or
resort to blank areas on the page.  It will be centered and will have a
caption.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\usepackage{caption}  % in preamble
  ...
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{pix/nix.png}
  \captionof{figure}{The spirit of the night} \label{pix:nix} % optional
\end{center}
</pre></div>

<p>This example puts a box with a graphic side by side with one having
text, with the two vertically centered.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\newcommand*{\vcenteredhbox}[1]{\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}#1\end{tabular}}
  ...
\begin{center}
  \vcenteredhbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{plot}}
  \hspace{1em}
  \vcenteredhbox{\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
                   \begin{displaymath}
                     f(x)=x\cdot \sin (1/x)
                   \end{displaymath}
                 \end{minipage}}
\end{center}
</pre></div>

<p>If you use the <samp>graphics</samp> package then the only options involve the
size of the graphic (but see <a href="#g_t_005crotatebox">\rotatebox</a> and <a href="#g_t_005cscalebox">\scalebox</a>).
When one optional argument is present then it is
<code>[<var>urx</var>,<var>ury</var>]</code> and it gives the coordinates of the top
right corner of the image, as a pair of TeX dimensions (see <a href="latex2e_14.html#Units-of-length">Units of length</a>).  If the units are omitted they default to <code>bp</code>.  In
this case, the lower left corner of the image is assumed to be at (0,0).
If two optional arguments are present then the leading one is
<code>[<var>llx</var>,<var>lly</var>]</code>, specifying the coordinates of the image&rsquo;s
lower left.  Thus, <code>\includegraphics[1in,0.618in]{...}</code> calls for
the graphic to be placed so it is 1&nbsp;inch wide and 0.618&nbsp;inches
tall and so its origin is at (0,0).
</p>
<p>The <samp>graphicx</samp> package gives you many more options.  Specify them
in a key-value form, as here.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1in,angle=90]{lion}
  \hspace{2em}
  \includegraphics[angle=90,width=1in]{lion}
\end{center}
</pre></div>

<p>The options are read left-to-right. So the first graphic above is made
one inch wide and then rotated, while the second is rotated and then
made one inch wide.  Thus, unless the graphic is perfectly square, the
two will end with different widths and heights.
</p>
<p>There are many options.  The primary ones are listed first.
</p>
<p>Note that a graphic is placed by LaTeX into a box, which is
traditionally referred to as its bounding box (distinct from the
PostScript BoundingBox described below).  The graphic&rsquo;s printed area may
go beyond this box, or sit inside this box, but when LaTeX makes up a
page it puts together boxes and this is the box allocated for the
graphic.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="includegraphics-width" class="anchor"></a></dd>
<dt><code>width</code></dt>
<dd><p>The graphic will be shown so its bounding box is this width.  An example
is <code>\includegraphics[width=1in]{plot}</code>.  You can use the standard
TeX dimensions (see <a href="latex2e_14.html#Units-of-length">Units of length</a>) and also convenient is
<code>\linewidth</code>, or in a two-column document, <code>\columnwidth</code>
(see <a href="latex2e_5.html#Page-layout-parameters">Page layout parameters</a>).  An example is that by using the
<samp>calc</samp> package you can make the graphic be 1&nbsp;cm narrow than
the width of the text with
<code>\includegraphics[width=\linewidth-1.0cm]{hefferon.jpg}</code>.

<p>and you give as options both <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> (or

<code>\includegraphics[angle=180,origin=c]{moon}</code> will turn the
picture upside down about that picture&rsquo;s center, while the command
<code>\includegraphics[angle=180,origin=lB]{LeBateau}</code> will turn its
picture upside down about its left baseline.  (The character <code>c</code>
gives the horizontal center in <code>bc</code> or <code>tc</code>, but gives the
vertical center in <code>lc</code> or <code>rc</code>.)  The default is <code>lB</code>.

<p>These options address the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript
graphic files, which have a size specified with a line
<code>%%BoundingBox</code> that appears in the file.  It has four values,
giving the lower <em>x</em> coordinate, lower <em>y</em> coordinate, upper
<em>x</em> coordinate, and upper <em>y</em> coordinate.  The units are
PostScript points, equivalent to TeX&rsquo;s big points, 1/72&nbsp;inch.
For example, if an <samp>.eps</samp> file has the line <code>%%BoundingBox 10
20 40 80</code> then its natural size is 30/72&nbsp;inch wide by
60/72&nbsp;inch tall.

<dd><p>If set to <code>true</code>, or just specified as with

<p>then LaTeX will look for <code>%%HiResBoundingBox</code> lines instead of

natural numbers while the <code>HiResBoundingBox</code> lines use decimals;
both use units equivalent to TeX&rsquo;s big points, 1/72&nbsp;inch.) To

<p>Put <var>material</var> in a box and rotate it <var>angle</var> degrees
counterclockwise.
</p>
<p>This example rotates the table column heads forty five degrees.
</p>
<div class="example">

<p>The <var>material</var> can be anything that goes in a box, including a graphic.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  \rotatebox[origin=c]{45}{\includegraphics[width=1in]{lion}}
</pre></div>

<p>To place the rotated material, the first step is that LaTeX sets
<var>material</var> in a box, with a reference point on the left baseline.
The second step is the rotation, by default about the reference point.
The third step is that LaTeX computes a box to bound the rotated
material.  Fourth, LaTeX moves this box horizontally so that the left
edge of this new bounding box coincides with the left edge of the box
from the first step (they need not coincide vertically).  This new
bounding box, in its new position, is what LaTeX uses as the box when
typesetting this material.
</p>
<p>If you use the <samp>graphics</samp> package then the rotation is about the
reference point of the box. If you use the <samp>graphicx</samp> package
then these are the options that can go in the <var>key-value list</var>,

<p>The <code>\reflectbox</code> command abbreviates
<code>\scalebox{-1}[1]{<var>material</var>}</code>.  Thus, <code>Able was

that size.  If either <var>horizontal length</var> or <var>vertical length</var>
is an exclamation point&nbsp;<code>!</code>  then the other argument is used
to determine a scale factor for both directions.
</p>
<p>This example makes the graphic be a half inch wide and scales it
vertically by the same factor to keep it from being distorted.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\resizebox{0.5in}{!}{\includegraphics{lion}}
</pre></div>

<p>The unstarred form <code>\resizebox</code> takes <var>vertical length</var> to be
the box&rsquo;s height while the starred form <code>\resizebox*</code> takes it to
be height+depth.  For instance, make the text have a height+depth of a
quarter inch with <code>\resizebox*{!}{0.25in}{\parbox{1in}{This
box has both height and depth.}}</code>.
</p>
<p>You can use <code>\depth</code>, <code>\height</code>, <code>\totalheight</code>, and
<code>\width</code> to refer to the original size of the box.  Thus, make the
text two inches wide but keep the original height with
